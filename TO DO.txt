-Clean my data by removing all instances where compounds didn't have a 3d version. Look for ",,,,,"

-Calculate bond lengths and bond angles with the data i've gathered

-Figure out how to graphically represent the data i've gathered, and what that would look like

-Add to my "visualise_smiles.py", so that it visualises 3d as well, to prove i can do that

-Create my GCN model, that accepts the 3d format i figured out before.
	-Remember spatial vs spectral convolutional networks

-Use a traditional machine learning method like logistic regression for SMILES strings, to benchmark

-Modify the DDI-GCN code to use SMILES strings, to benchmark

I NEED:
[X] Atoms, [X] Bonds, [X] Coordinates, [X] Charge

I NEED TO CALCULATE:
Bond Lengths, Bond Angles and Dihedral Angles
