Topic: ADR Prediction
Model type: Hybrid, single label prediction
Data: A mix of ChEMBL, PubChem and SIDER
Methods: Implement existing models for the data, as well as my hybrid model, and compare their performance

My understand of what the hybrid model will look like:
I will likely have three models, one for capturing patterns in the chemical structures, one for the protein interactions, and one for
side effects. I then combine each of these outputs, run it through an FC layer, and get my predictions.
